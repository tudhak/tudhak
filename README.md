- 👋 Hi, I’m @tudhak !
- 👀 I have recently completed a Web development bootcamp at Le Wagon and I’m familiar with Ruby on Rails. Since then, I'm interested in growing my skills through continuous learning and engaging in new projects.
- 🌱 I’m currently strengthening my Ruby / Ruby on Rails skills and have started learning React, Node.js and Tailwind CSS.
- 💞️ I’m looking to join an inspiring team to gain further experience.
- 📫 Please take a look at my website: https://www.hatteetud.com
