- 👋 Hi, I’m @tudhak !
- 👀 I have recently completed a Web development bootcamp at Le Wagon and I’m familiar with Ruby on Rails and Vanilla JS. Since then, I'm interested in growing my skills through continuous learning and engaging in new projects.
- 🌱 Currently, I am learning and practising React, Node.js and Tailwind CSS by working on the new website of a company teaching private lessons with the tech team, improving the 2gethR web app to add functionalities and achieve cleaner code, and taking several courses to strengthen my skills.
- 💞️ I’m looking to join an inspiring team to gain further experience.
- 📫 Please take a look at my website: https://www.hatteetud.com
